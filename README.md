# wordlist-generator
A simple wordlist dictionary generator. Inputs a file with words on newlines, specify minimum and maximum word complexity and outputs all iterations. Good for brute-force dictionary attacks.

Simular to Crunch program, however with less functionality and primaraily for words opposed to letters.
